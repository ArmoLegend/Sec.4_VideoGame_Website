    <h3> A little about the game </h3>
       <p>  Club Penguin was an online-based, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (abbreviated as a MMORPG) created by Disney Canada Inc. (previously New Horizons Interactive) in the summer of 2005. It had a public Beta Testing in August 2005, and was officially launched on October 24, 2005. It was later bought by Disney in August 2007. It involved a virtual world, where the players were penguins, and was featuring a large range of minigames and other online activities, and was based on a snowy island, after which the game was named.
Club Penguin has been noted as sharing similarities with other popular browser-based online environments such as RuneScape and Habbo Hotel, such as the use of an in-game currency to purchase virtual items and pets, named "puffles". The game was specifically designed for players within the ages of 6-14 (however all ages can play), thus child safety was a vital responsibility of the game's developers. The game was founded by Lance Priebe, and co-founded by Lane Merrifield, and Dave Krysko. There were over 330,000,000 penguin accounts created and played in over 190 countries. It was estimated that over 150 million people worldwide played Club Penguin.</p>
