      <h4>Review</h4>
      <p>Avalanche Studios is known for making their games, like Just Cause, very hectic. This means that there is a lot of action. Every mission done inn Just Cause resolves in a BOOM, flames flying everywhere. There is a lot of running, driving, and flying involved. You would do this during missions or on your own time. </p>
