    <h3> What is Kirby Super Star? </h3>
    <p> Bad guys are stealing food from Dreamland and you must play as kirby and defeat these villains. In kirby super star there are eight different games (as seen on the cover) and they all features various different games and styles of playing with the pink fluffball. There is springbreeze, in this game whispy woods thinks you are bothering the forest  where you go through 4 stages and get a chance to defeat whispy woods. Dynablade, where you go through level to eventually defeat dynablade the bird  that comes to attack you because it thinks you stole and ate its baby children. Megaton Punch where kirby tests his punching force on many different enemies using tiny minigames. You can race against King Dedede to a foot race in Gourmet Race while you eat food and dodge attacks.In the Great Cave Offensive kirby falls into a mine and his objective is to collect all of the treasures found, Samurai Kirby where you test your reaction by clicking a button when an ! point pops up and this happens against other enemies. Milky way wishes which features kirby battling against marx a fellow dreamlander and its sequel the arena. Finally revenge of metaknight (my personal favourite) is unlocked when the other games are beaten, in this mode you defeat meta knight and take down his ship, as the ship goes down meta knight challenges you to the duel and when you defeat him you beat the game.  </p>
