  <p>
    For nearly 30 years, the Sid Meier's Civilization series has been defining
	the strategy game genre and for good reason. The thought of building your
	own nation from ancient times to the modern day and beyond while competing
	with others for world domination is an interesting idea and translates
	beautifully as a video game. By far one of the series' best points is just
	how much content has been added since it's beginning in 1991, whether it
	be new playable civilizations, completely redesigning previous features or
	even making the game's presentation more updated, every Civilization game
	feels way different and improved than the last. Civilization VI continues
	this trend and many find it to work amazingly. Not a single playable
	civilization seems out of place here, whether you're trying to enforce
	naval supremacy as the Kongo or charging into Rome on your war elephant
	while being commanded by a blood-thirsty Mahatma Gandhi, this game really
	allows for creativity in how you plan to shape your empire for the future.
	But say taking over the world isn't on your to-do-list today, so instead
	you decide to colonize another solar system or make your belief of the
	great chicken gods the world religion again highlighting the flexibility
	you have as a player to win a game.
