      <div class="Introduction">
          <p> No matter if you enjoy single-player gameplay or online racing, <em> Gran Turismo Sport </em> has you covered. For playing alone, the game offers a great quality of racing and technical challenges. You must win at least a bronze medal in each challenge to unlock the next one. While that does mean a lot of content is locked initially, it does force you to master each challenge. This does help if your trying to improve your racing skills especially if your starting to try a true Manuel Transmision. </p>

        <h2> Welcome to Gran Turismo Sport</h2>
      <div class="Main Content">
          <p>Each challenge shows the results of your friends, so in addition to aiming for gold it’s fun to beat their scores. Challenges test a wide variety of skills from accelerating, to corning, to winning races, and more. By the end you’ll be very familiar with a range of cars, circuit layouts, and skills needed to win.
All these events also reinforce Gran Turismo Sport‘s simulation approach. Bad driving techniques aren’t tolerated because the goal is make you a better driver. After spending a few hours practicing braking, cornering, and driving faster it was time to check out the game’s online racing. </p>
