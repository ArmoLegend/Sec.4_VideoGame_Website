    <h3>The Review</h3>
    <p>Flappy Golf takes the flapping control formula from the mega-popular Flappy Bird game and brings it to the 2D golf courses from Stickman Golf.
The result is fun way to play through the enormous Noodlecake Studios golf course library with a new way to get the ball into the hole.
When I first saw Flappy Golf hit the App Store, I understandably rolled my eyes -- haven't we had enough flappy games? But once I started 
playing, I immediately saw how well it works with a golf game. The Stickman Golf games have been a big hit for both iOS and Android since 
the launch of the original Stickman Golf in 2010. The simple 2D graphics hid excellent gameplay, and the sequel, Super Stickman Golf 2, 
built upon an already excellent gaming concept.</p>
