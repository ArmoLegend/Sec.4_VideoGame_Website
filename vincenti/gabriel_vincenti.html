    <p>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a video game that was based on its television series. 
       It revolves around franchise and the life of magical ponies that work together to create a happy and peaceful 
       community and fight crime.</p>

      <li>Characters: Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, and Applejack.</li>
      <li>Setting: Fairytale Land.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Who is it For?</h3>
    <p>This video game is intended for children. More specifically young girls. Although I believe 
       teens would also enjoy this video game as it deals with a franchise, businesses, etc.</p>
