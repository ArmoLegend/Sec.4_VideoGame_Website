     <h3> What is CS:GO? </h3>
     <p> Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or commonly known as CSGO is a first person shooter developed in 2012 by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment, today it is currently available on Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Linux. In December 2018 the game was made free to play. The game is compromised of two teams, these are the counter-terrorists and the terrorists. The goal of the game for the terrorists is the blowup one of the two bombsites on the map or eliminate the other 5 counter-terrorists. The goal of the game for the  counter-terrorist is to stop the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or elimate the other 5 terrorists. </p>

     <h3> Game Review</h3>
     <p> Counter Strike Global Offensive is one of the most popular FPS games in recent years. CSGO came out in the year 2012 and came as a new adapted version of the earlier game,
Counter Strike Source, I have been following Counter-Strike since it's release and when it came out, it was a game like no other. In recent years it has come to a decline due
to updates being very small and no gameplay changes being prominent enough to bring people back to the game or new players to the game. Until recently, it has been like this,
but in December 2018 CSGO was made free for the general public and the patch before had massive changes. This has brought a new audeince to the game and I will be reviewing it
up until this point. In my experience CSGO has been a very enjoyable game to play. I have many hours on the game and I can say this is a perfect game to either enjoy with your
friends, be competitive with or just even having fun.</p>
