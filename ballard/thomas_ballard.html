     <h3> What is CS:GO? </h3>
     <p> Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or commonly known as CSGO is a first person shooter developed in 2012 by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment, today it is currently available on Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Linux. In December 2018 the game was made free to play. The game is compromised of two teams, these are the counter-terrorists and the terrorists. The goal of the game for the terrorists is the blowup one of the two bombsites on the map or eliminate the other 5 counter-terrorists. The goal of the game for the  counter-terrorist is to stop the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or elimate the other 5 terrorists. </p>

	<h3> How to Play CS:GO </h3>
	<p> To play CS:GO you will most likely need a couple things before hoping into the game, for how to play the game everything I will be referring to will be PC related, and not from the console versions of the game. So, firstly before we start playign the game you must have a Steam account and a copy of the game, currently the game is free therefore you will not have a problem obtaining a copy. Learning the basics of CS:GO is like almost every FPS game where you shoot to kill, but if you want to constanly improve at the game you will need to put in effort into learning the game, this includes reading guides, watching professional play, practice for countless hours, and do not forget to have fun playing the game. Another thing that is highly recommended is to own a headset with a microphone available to talk to teammates in-game. Now that we have some requirements, we are ready to play. Before you start playing for ranked you have to get to level 2, this can be obtained easily through casual play and gain experience points through that. When playing the game you will realize instantly two things, there is no iron-sights (zooming in your gun) and there is an economy system to the game. Because of these two things this is what makes CS:GO different from franchises such as Call of Duty, because the guns do not have the function of zooming in, you have to take advantage of your crosshair placement (where you place the crosshair on the enemies body), damage on an enemy changes based off where you put your crosshair. Normally you will want to aim at the head as it secures the most damage. With crosshairs, also comes guns. You will want to pick normally an AK-47 if you are a terrorist and a M4A4 or M4A1-S on counter-terrorist. If you want a sniper an AWP is a perfect example of one you can buy if sniping is more what you want. Secondly the economy system works based on how many people you kill, with what guns you kill the enemy, if you plant the bomb, if you defuse the bomb and whether you lost or won the round. These are the two differences mainly that CS:GO has that other games might not have. Learning how to improve your aim and controlling your economy and the economy of your team is a vital point of winning games. To have examples of pro play, you will have search up guides and pro-players which I will mention briefly, and how esports can be great for new players to watch. </p>

     <h3> Game Review</h3>
     <p> Counter Strike Global Offensive is one of the most popular FPS games in recent years. CSGO came out in the year 2012 and came as a new adapted version of the earlier game,
Counter Strike Source, I have been following Counter-Strike since it's release and when it came out, it was a game like no other. In recent years it has come to a decline due
to updates being very small and no gameplay changes being prominent enough to bring people back to the game or new players to the game. Until recently, it has been like this,
but in December 2018 CSGO was made free for the general public and the patch before had massive changes. This has brought a new audeince to the game and I will be reviewing it
up until this point. In my experience CSGO has been a very enjoyable game to play. I have many hours on the game and I can say this is a perfect game to either enjoy with your
friends, be competitive with or just even having fun.</p>
