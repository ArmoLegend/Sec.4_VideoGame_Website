      <h2>Basic Info</h2>
      <p>Black Desert Online is arguably the forefront MMO RPG today. No other game rivals it's graphics, and highly responsive
                action system.
                
                When you start the game, you can choose from one of the many classes. This choice isn't final, and you can change your class
         later on. The options are:
      <ul>
         <li>Ranger: she uses a bow and is a high DPS ranged character.</li>
         <li>Warrior: he uses a greatsword, as has a great combination of offense and defense.</li>
         <li>Berserker: a grab heavy class that has a high damage potential while being incredibly tanky.</li>
         <li>Valkyrie</li>
         <li>Wizard</li>
         <li>Witch</li>
         <li>Sorceress</li>
         <li>Dark Knight</li>
         <li>Maewha</li>
         <li>Musa</li>
         <li>Ninja</li>
         <li>Kunoichi</li>
         <li>Striker</li>
         <li>Mystic</li>
         <li>Tamer</li>
         <li>Archer</li>
         <li>Lahn</li>
       </ul>
      <p>The basic content in the game is rather simple. There are quests, that involve exploring the world, interacting with NPCs and 
         killing monsters. There is grinding, which will likely be your main source of income in the game. Grinding is the act of killing
         mobs over and over and collecting the drops which you can then sell to make silver. The main focus and speialt of the game however,
         is the PvP content. There are 1v1s, 3v3 scrimages, and in the later game you and your guild can fight other guilds for terriories
         and silver. Finally, the other main source of income is lifeskills. They are as follows:
       <ul>
         <li>Gathering</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Trading</li>
          <li>Training</li>
          <li>Processing</li>
          <li>Fishing</li>
          <li>Alchemy</li>
          <li>Hunting</li>
          <li>Farming</li>
          <li>Hunting</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="Community">
    <h2>The Community</h2>
     <p>The game's playerbase is rather large, especially on the NA and EU servers. While most players are helpful and friendly, trolls,
          karma-bombers and pranksters are common, and as a new player you should watch out. My recommendation is to join a guild as 
          soon as possible, one with an active community. They will be able to teach you about the game and what to do.</p>

    <div class="Experience">
       <h2>My Experience</h2>
       <p>My own experience with the game is an overall positive one. I have spent over 3000 hours in the game. While it can sometimes be 
          tedious, the fun you have with your friends and your guildmates will be worth it, no matter the numerous issues with game.</p>
