      <p>Super Smash Bros. 4 is the fourth game in the Super Smash Bros. franchise. It was released on the 3DS and Wii U consoles. This review
        will be reviewing the game in general, and not so much of the differences between the 3DS and Wii U versions. This game brought many 
        new game modes to the series, such as Smash Run, and new characters (old favourites from previous games return as well) and new stages to fight on.
        Characters, stages and items come from a variety of game franchises, which has always been the Super Smash Bros Series' winning factor. 
        You can fight with your favourite characters from games you played in the past, and battle with characters from other games you might
        of played/encountered throughout your gaming experiences. This and the fact that you can battle fellow gamers around the world,
        makes the Super Smash Bros franchise a very special and loved series. Super Smash Bros. 4 definitely deserves to be called a Smash Bros game, 
        however this does not mean it has no faults or mistakes.
