        <h4> Rating 9/10 </h4>
        <p>This game deserves a 9 out of 10 because it contains a great
          story along with amazing gameplay. What really blows this game
          out of thr water is its stunning visuals. Things that make the
          game even better is its amusing multiplayer. What dosen't make this
          a perfect 10/10 is its bloated third act which is when the content 
          becomes a little repetitive from its previous 3 games.</p>

        <h4> Review </h4> 
        <p> Uncharted 4: A Theif's End is a remarkable acheivement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. 
          Though it's let down by a lack of immmagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that 
          drags on far too long. Uncharted 4 carries on the series' proud tradition of peerless polish and style, 
          wiht a great multiplayer component to boot.Most importantly, it's a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group 
          of characters we've known for nine years. A worthy thief's end, indeed. (IGN The Verdict)
