<h3>History of the Game</h3>
<p>
Donkey kong was one of the greatest games to known to man. This game first came into existence in the arcades in 1981. The game first
  started with Donkey Kong and by 1882 Donkey Kong Jr. came along. When the first version of the game came out, donkey Kong was
  known as the bad guy and Jumpman (soon to be called Mario) was known as the character who had to save his girlfriend Pauline (soon to be 
  called princess Peach). The idea for the name Kong came from the movie King Kong and the idea for the name Donkey was chosen because 
  Donkey apprentely means dumb or stupid in Japenenese.
